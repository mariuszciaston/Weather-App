# Weather-App

Just a weather app to train and show my asynchronous code and API handling skills.

Features:<br>
• Background color is based on temperature! (hsl color space interpolates from blue when it's freezing cold to red when it's hot)<br>
• Search by (city/country) name<br>
• Search by current location<br>
• Buttons with sample locations<br>
• Change of measurement units (metric / imperial)<br>
